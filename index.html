        <p class="col-sm-9" ><b>Gender equality</b> is not only a fundamental human right, but a necessary foundation 
            for a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable world. There has been progress over the 
            last decades: More girls are going to school, fewer girls are forced into early marriage,
            more women are serving in parliament and positions of leadership,and laws are being
            reformed to advance gender equality. Despite these gains, many challenges 
            remain: discriminatory laws and social norms remain pervasive, women continue to be 
            underrepresented at all levels of political leadership, and 1 in 5 women and girls 
            between the ages of 15 and 49 report experiencing physical or sexual violence by an
            intimate partner within a 12-month period.</p>

            The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could reverse the limited progress that has been made 
            on gender equality and women’s rights.  The coronavirus outbreak exacerbates existing inequalities 
            for women and girls across every sphere – from health and the economy, to security and social protection. 
            Women play a disproportionate role in responding to the virus, including as frontline healthcare
            workers and carers at home. Women’s unpaid care work has increased significantly as a result of school 
            closures and the increased needs of older people. Women are also harder hit by the economic impacts of
            COVID-19, as they disproportionately work in insecure labour markets. Nearly 60 per cent of women work
            in the informal economy, which puts them at greater risk of falling into poverty.The pandemic has also 
            led to a steep increase in violence against women and girls. With lockdown measures in place, many women
            are trapped at home with their abusers, struggling to access services that are suffering from cuts and
            restrictions. Emerging data shows that, since the outbreak of the pandemic, violence against women and 
            girls – and particularly domestic violence – has intensified. </p>
